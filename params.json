{"name":"dkgrieshammer","tagline":"interaction | product | sound","body":"### About\r\nHi, my name is David Grieshammer and I recently finished my design studies in Cologne. Starting from audio I was hiring out as a graphic & web designer for a couple of years. During studies my interest and my projects grew more into interaction design and human experience, HMI for automotive, industrial and medical demands, or the research of more intricate relations between lifeforms and objects.\r\n\r\nWhen not working or hacking some fun projects, I’m doing the usual stuff all people do like lazing in the park, populating cinemas & parties, bouldering and reading a book now and then. If you want to get in touch let’s have a coffee somewhere or, if that is to much reality, there’s always the social media for you –\r\n\r\n### Experience\r\n\r\n**dkgrieshammer** | Interface & Interaction Design\r\n<br/>since 2005<br/>\r\nInterface & Service Design research & prototyping for automotive, medical & industrial systems | Interaction Design & Hardware Hacking | Experimental Interface research\r\n\r\n**ZKS center for clinical trials, University Hospitals of Cologne** | Interaction Design \r\n<br/>since 2012<br/> \r\nInteraction & Service Design for clinical trials | Information Architecture & HMI for critical data systems\r\n\r\n**Cologne University of Applied Sciences** | Research Assistant | Blended Studies\r\n<br/>2007 - 2012<br/>\r\nResearch & Design in Blended Media Studies | 5 years with a great team in conception, prototyping & development of online collaboration platforms and tools for university environments | conception & design of online study management tools\r\n\r\n**KHM Academy of Media Arts Cologne** | Research Assistant | Audio Laboratory \r\n<br/>2007 - 2010 <br/>\r\nExperimental audio research | Technical Assistance | Tutoring\r\n\r\n### Education\r\n\r\n**KISD Köln International School of Design** | Dipl.

I'd say I'm a creative generalist able to design artefacts, plan & evaluate usage-flows, write a Java-Class as well as to build a product model in Rhino3D – but mostly I think it's all about getting together, evaluate different concepts & pushing mutually towards new realms of imaginations.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

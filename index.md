### About
Hi, my name is David Grieshammer and I recently finished my design studies in Cologne. Starting from audio I was hiring out as a graphic & web designer for a couple of years. During studies my interest and my projects grew more into interaction design and human experience, HMI for automotive, industrial and medical demands, or the research of more intricate relations between lifeforms and objects.

When not working or hacking some fun projects, I’m doing the usual stuff all people do like lazing in the park, populating cinemas & parties, bouldering and reading a book now and then. If you want to get in touch let’s have a coffee somewhere or, if that is to much reality, there’s always the social media for you –

Design*

### Style & Approach

To think, to explain & to work in a team seem to me as the most important points leading to good results. I'd say I'm a creative generalist able to design artefacts, plan & evaluate usage-flows, write a Java-Class as well as to build a product model in Rhino3D – but mostly I think it's all about getting together, evaluate different concepts & pushing mutually towards new realms of imaginations.
